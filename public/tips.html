   <h1>How to write a good resume</h1> 
<p>Your resume must clearly, concisely and strategically present your qualifications to get a recruiter interested in meeting you. It should convey your skills, work experience and assets. The resume is used to describe what you can accomplish professionally in a manner that also illustrates what you can do for an employer. Job opportunities can arise unexpectedly. An updated modern resume is the key to a successful job search. Here are some do's and don'ts of how to write a good resume and what to include.</p>

<h1>Resume Writing Do's</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Keep your resume clear and concise
        An employer takes an average of 30 seconds to skim a resume. You want them to see right away that you are qualified for the position.
        </li> 
     <li>Proofread your resume numerous times
        Be sure there are no spelling or grammar mistakes. Have someone else read it over as well. A simple spelling mistake on a resume can give a negative impression to the employer. It can even prevent you from getting the job.</li>
    
    <li> Limit your resume to two pages
        Place the emphasis of your resume on your most recent experience. Older jobs and experience that are more than 15 years old should either be cut out or minimized. This way, the employer can focus on more relevant information.</li>
    
     <li>Tailor your resume to suit the position you are applying for
        Specify work experience or achievements that are related to the position you are applying to. This can be done by reviewing the job description or the employer website.
        </li>
     <li>Highlight what you have accomplished
        You want to be able to identify the best examples of where you demonstrated your skills. These examples should speak to what you achieved in your role, and should demonstrate what kind of employee you are. It is best to include this information in the "Work experience" section of the resume.</li>
    
     <li>Be honest
        Lying on your resume is never a good idea. You don't want to overstate your skills or results as it will mislead the employer. Have confidence in what you have to offer.</li>
    
     
     </ul>
 
     <h1>Resume Writing Don'ts</h1>
<ul>
    
    <li>Don't use an inappropriate email address.</li> 
   
 <li> Don't include unnecessary personal information
    It is best to leave out any personal details such as age, weight, height, marital status, religious preference, political views, or any other personal attributes that could be controversial. This will prevent any potential bias. Most importantly, never include your Social Insurance Number in your resume.</li>  
   
   <li>Don't include a picture of yourself
    Although in some countries it may be acceptable to include a photo, it is not the norm in Canada. It can actually lower your chances of obtaining a position and divert the whole focus of your resume. You want the employer to focus on your skills and experience, not what you look like.</li> 
   
    <li>Don't use too many bullets
        Make your resume easy to read by limiting each resume section or sub section to 5-7 bullet points. This will make it easier for the employer to scan your resume and identify your potential. Each bullet point should be used wisely by keeping the information relevant and concise.</li>
    
   
  <li>Don't use personal pronouns
    Do not use "I," "my," or "me". Write your resume in the third person, as if it's being written by someone else.</li>  
   
  </ul>
